## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. Some packages will be dowloaded online (such as stopwords in nltk).

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The datasets are provided as part of udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree projects. The objective is to implement recommendation techniques using data from the IBM Watson Studio platform. i.e., `Recommendations with IBM`. The following techniques have been explored and implemented.

1. Rank-Based Recommendations
2. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
3. Content Based Recommendations with NLP
4. Matrix Factorization (SVD) Based Recommendation


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

All the analysis are combined in one single notebook. The notebook is exploratory with titles and sections to showcase work relatd to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

Results are contained in the notebook as well.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credit to IBM abd Udacity for the data. Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
